Prisoner

Up at 5am, switching the pins !

Listening to Underworld on Apple Music at 7.40 am.

Read about prisoners spending more time outdoors than the average UK kid.

Great marketing on every level from Persil.

Makes you think.

Makes other talk.

Parent guilt trip.

Provocative.

Here's the video

Now back to 24 hours with the King of Snake.
